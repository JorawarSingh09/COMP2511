From the result table, it could easily observe that average time for sort is shorter than average time for useIntList. There is another finding that the time taken for useIntList to calculate a reverse order input is shorter than usual time taken. The reason for this finding is that there are for loops execute when my code meet a input value larger than L->last and input value in between two data. This means while my code deal with a reverse order input, it doesn't need to execute for loop. The sort function form command line might have another algorithms which don't need a for loop. This might be the main reason.
